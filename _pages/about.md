I am a PhD student from the AI department at IIT Hyderabad. I am part of the Machine Learning and Vision Group supervised by [Dr. Vineeth N Balasubramanian](https://people.iith.ac.in/vineethnb/index.html) where, broadly, I explore how concept-based learning can help models learn tasks better with a focus, also, on the interpretability of these models.
Prior to this, I was an M.Tech student in the University of Hyderabad where I did my thesis under the supervision of [Dr. Satish Narayana Srirama](https://scis.uohyd.ac.in/~srirama/) on distributed machine learning.
